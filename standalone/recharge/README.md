# Recharge Standalone Page

This package contains an isolated version of the recharge screen with the same layout as the original project.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

To build the page for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Prebuilt bundle

If you only need the compiled assets, open `dist/index.html` directly in your
browser or deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to any static host. The
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and icons inside `dist/` were generated to match the UI
and interactions of the Vue source without requiring a build step in this
environment.
